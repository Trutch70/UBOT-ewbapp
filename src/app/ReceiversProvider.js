        "description": "<p>PIECEOFSHIRT began as a vintage merch store, which grew into a brand with its own designs, the main specialty of which is bootlegs. Among PIECEOFSHIRT's most recognizable pieces are the charity drop T-shirts with “Stolen Island” and “Ukraine” prints, playing off the logos of Stone Island and musician Aphex Twin. The team sold 350 T-shirts and transferred 130 thousand hryvnias to volunteers.</p>\n<p>The brand's founder, <strong>Reshat Brat</strong>, has long been fond of skate culture: he skateboarded and collected merch from various music groups. In 2017, a year after moving to Kyiv, Reshat opened an Instagram store of vintage merch PIECEOFSHIRT, and this marked the beginning of the brand's story.</p>\n<blockquote><em>\"It was a way of communicating with the city; at that time, I didn't know anyone in Kyiv. I met a person, who gave away a T-shirt, </em><strong><em>but it was more important to me who I was selling it to than the fact of the sale itself</em></strong><em>.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p>Reshat always wanted to create his own clothing design: during the operation of the vintage store, he began to understand prints and materials, and in 2020, PIECEOFSHIRT presented the first collection.</p>\n<h3>About the team and production</h3>\n<p>There are two people on the team — Reshat, and Dima. Reshat deals with designs, organization of production, and content, and Dima deals with communication, sales, and shipments. Friends help them at almost all stages (correction of designs, production, sales, photo-video content).</p>\n<blockquote><em>\"If we talk about the beginning of PIECEOFSHIRT's existence, then </em><strong><em>the team first appeared, and then the brand</em></strong><em>. My brothers Ivan and Danylo helped start production and promote designs based on my eponymous Instagram store with vintage merch in 2020,”.</em></blockquote>\n<p>The idea behind the PIECEOFSHIRT brand is to develop limited edition drops printed on vintage t-shirts. However, production was never constant.</p>\n<blockquote><em>\"We just dropped new things when there was time and inspiration. All previous and current drops were printed in Kyiv with the participation of our friend Anton (Walls Press). From February 24 to April 1, he and his family were in Plakhtianka, Makariv district, under the occupation of the Russian invaders, almost without communication. Everyone here was worried and waiting for him. Fortunately, he overcame his terrible test of fate and returned to Kyiv.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p>The first items of the brand were long sleeves with bootleg design \"ЦОЙ DIVISION\" (TSOI DIVISION, which refers to Victor Tsoi) and the series dedicated to the pandemic \"STAY AWAY\" + \"2020\". Longsleeves \"Х*Й ВОЙНЕ\" (FUCK THE WAR) were released next: 21 units of a single edition were sold in less than a day.</p>\n<blockquote><em>\"Playing logos, making bootlegs (in PIECEOFSHIRT's case, ironic parodies) is our forte. This is a fairly common technique, with the help of which the design first attracts attention as something quite familiar, and only then conveys the author's opinion,\"</em></blockquote>\n<p>For us, as well as for many, the words <strong>Made in Ukraine</strong> are extremely powerful. And we want our business to consist entirely of these powerful words.</p>\n",

When all my relatives and friends had my cups and bowls, I realised that ceramics is more than a hobby for me. Now I follow my dream, and pottery is my full-time career. I travel a lot, so some of <strong>my dinnerware is inspired by nature</strong>. I find it exciting that people from all over the world can get my pottery.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>My pieces are made from natural clay on a pottery wheel.</strong> All items are formed and glazed by hand, so each has an individual shape and colour. The glazes are lead-free and food safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ceramics can combine art and functionality. A unique vase or fruit bowl will create a mood and warm atmosphere in your home. <strong>Handmade always is a great gift.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My studio is located in Kyiv, where I'm working and sending international mail. In addition, I will send part of the money from the purchase to humanitarian organisations. Thank you for your support!</p>\n",

One package contains 60 pieces, designed for daily use during the month. <br><br>KYSEN’ founder Serhii Poroshenko's comment on how the war affected the work of the brand:</p>\n<blockquote><em>“We had planned to launch the production of eye patches in Ukraine before the war. We had almost everything for this: equipment (which passed certification in 2020 and 2021), production technology cards and raw materials, but the war changed our plans. As a result, in March 2022 we lost one warehouse with a majority of our products (Kyiv region) and the second one in April (Vinnytsia region). It was quite hard for me to go through what happened, but the essential thing is that the whole team is alive. So in April when most people were still in a stupor due to the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, I decided to act. In peacetime, we were planning to produce this blue and yellow eye patch line for the Independence Day of Ukraine, but it became our manifestation of courage here and now. It is the kind of courage that resonates with the main idea of the Brave.ua campaign. So, that’s how the idea of creating blue and yellow patches in collaboration with Brave.ua appeared. Now our team is rapidly growing and developing. We see that our products are top-rated, so we are planning to enter European and American markets. We believe that the future belongs to the brave, and victory to those who will not back down!”</em></blockquote>\n",

This inspired me to start upcycling.</em></p>\n<p><em>In general, upcycling (</em><strong><em>up+recycling</em></strong><em>) is the process of creative rethinking and transforming left-out materials or abandoned things into new products with a higher value, in order to reduce waste and to preserve resources.</em></p>\n<p><em>In my work, the main aim is to bring the artistic interpretation of authentic features, meanings, and memory, still carried by upcycled objects, in order to transfer the energy embodied in the material - μεταφορά (from the Ancient Greek - transference). </em></p>\n<p><em>With such a conversion, I strive to reproduce a certain harmony that I feel, believing that my creations radiate the vital vibes I put into them.</em></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The upcycling manufactory Metåfora is currently at the initial stage of its development, being gradually implemented on the basis of a Kyiv local independent center of informal culture and creative practices - Ostriv Platform, as in an incubator with a dynamic creative environment and technical conditions for experimentation and prototyping.</p>\n<p><strong>The future plan</strong> is to develop the upcycling manufactory Metåfora to the level of a permanent creative ecological and social enterprise that would work on the principle of \"zero waste\".&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It will become both a creative, experimental laboratory and a cultural and educational center that will unite and expand a community of creative conscious people with common values of love for nature and caring for its resources.</p>\n<p><strong>There is a war</strong></p>\n<p>Russia's war against Ukraine completely changed my life and plans. But thanks to our defenders, I manage to stay at home in Kyiv with my friends and relatives.</p>\n<p>In the first months of the war, our creative workshop functioned as a humanitarian headquarters and all artistic projects were stopped because they were considered out of date and seemed to have lost their value.</p>\n<p>But now I feel that, in contrast to all the horror and constant threats that the enemy has brought to my homeland and compatriots, there is a growing need to affirm life in all ways, to express my identity and to be useful with my skills. Therefore, I will continue the implementation of the project as far and as long as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n",

When we didn't find exactly what we wanted, we decided to create it ourselves. We chose 100% softened linen as an ecological, natural, durable, and pleasant-to-the-touch material.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Later, we decided to add linen curtains, tablecloths, napkins, robes, and other textiles to the assortment in order to wrap the whole family in love, care, aesthetics, and natural materials.</p>\n<p><strong>Our brand fulfills orders based on individual requests and adds personalized embroidery to make the gift special.</strong></p>\n<p>On the first day of the war, we froze; on the second - we began to offer our linen for Molotov cocktails, but our request was declined because there were already enough fabrics in the volunteer headquarters. Later on, new orders started coming to us little by little, and we realized that <strong>we need to continue working because each of our client's orders is the salary for our employees, payments for materials to our stakeholders, and taxes to the budget.</strong> We prepared special lots for charity auctions, where our tablecloths and Panama hats helped raise funds for the Armed Forces. A few of the items that are available we sell to send 100% of the funds to the volunteers that take care of the needs of the Armed Forces. We believe that <strong>Victory is coming</strong> soon.&nbsp;</p>\n",

Yes, we know it's a little bit strange - it's grey and wet and freezing so it's hard to enjoy it. But for us, it is a month of love because we, the brand's founders - Victoria Furmanyuk and Andriy Bushmakin - met each other in February. No surprise we launched our brand in February as well, in 2020. And maybe one day our colorful sweaters will make you love this month as much as we do.</p>\n<h3>Bright colors</h3>\n<p>In Feb we believe that after the rain always comes the rainbow. This natural phenomenon is our eternal source of inspiration and hope for the best.</p>\n<h3>Slow fashion</h3>\n<p>We're not in a hurry to become huge. It's important for us to stay honest and be able to afford ourselves the luxury of slowing down and growing naturally. This means we always have a permanent line and new colors and styles will be added as time goes on. We also produce our sweaters in small quantities to avoid overproduction and dead stock. We appreciate your patience if the color or style required is not available at the moment and you have to wait for a little to get your own Feb sweater.</p>\n<h3>No trends and fashion seasons</h3>\n<p>In Feb we want you to wear sweaters all day, day after day, season after season. That's why we source the finest quality Italian merino wool and produce our sweaters at a small Kyiv-based atelier so we can pay attention to every detail and step of creating Feb products. They are cool in winter and summer no matter if it is 2020, 2025, or 2030 - Feb sweaters are made to last.</p>\n",

From the first days, our team is engaged in charity work, providing MIXTURA cosmetics for military personnel and soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, making Molotov cocktails, and selling \"Come Back Alive\" boxes. 80% of the funds from the sales of these boxes are sent to help the Armed Forces of Ukraine. At first, the team, like all Ukrainians, was in shock from the war, losses, and uncertainty. Buyers behaved in the same way. Everything seemed to freeze. But later, when the complete shock passed, we realized that life must go on, and the Ukrainian economy must work. And we do what we do best - make high-quality natural cosmetics. MIXTURA stood on the economic side of protecting our country. We even noticed that after the start of hostilities, Ukrainians began to prefer Ukrainian brands and support domestic manufacturers. Every day we send orders to the most dangerous parts of the country - the cities and towns of Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Donetsk, and Zaporizhia regions. And we really want to believe that we can give at least a little bit of home and protection atmosphere.<br><br>Therefore, we continue to make high-quality and natural products.</p>\n",

I liked to watch the development of the life of the plants, and how they germinated, ripened, and gave a harvest. That was the time when the idea of giving this feeling to people was born in my head.</p>\n<p>I accidentally came across microgreens, read about them, and started growing them at home.</p>\n<p>I realised: I want to create kits for you to grow greens yourself. But not in the way it was on the market (products from plastic and unprofessional attitude towards the client), but something special, from which you can make a brand.</p>\n<p>I found a designer with whom we became partners for a while and started developing the product. <strong>A beautiful, eco-friendly product.</strong></p>\n<p>When the full-scale war began, we stopped somewhere at the end of March until our regular customers started writing to us with the desire to order something.</p>\n<p>Then people began to return to Ukraine, and our sets began to be taken as a gift: \"my friend/girlfriend/mother returned to Ukraine, I want to congratulate her,\" that's what clients often told us.</p>\n<p><strong>We believe Ukraine will win the war and the Ukrainian market will prosper, but we want to go global.</strong></p>\n<p>Customers often tell us that they want something new in growing, so we have started producing mushroom grow kits, and we will be adding new kits for growing mint and basil in the coming months.</p>\n<p><strong>The war did not break, nor does it tire us: we have our own front - we create value for those on the home front.</strong> So they could stay in better shape and help our warriors on the front in a better way.</p>\n<p><strong>From selling our products, we pay taxes, donate to foundations, pay suppliers, and our team.</strong></p>\n<p>To get a microgreen eco-kit from grow-some, please write us directly on Instagram.</p>\n",

Our sewists went to different places, warehouses with fabric closed, and customers did not receive their orders, which were waiting in line. At first, we didn't know what to do. But after waiting a few weeks, we decided to resume work and try to reorganize production. Finally, we had a small number of fabrics in stock, found sewists in safe regions, made English versions of the site, and targeted Europe, enabling us to support our team, preserve the brand, and send % of orders for humanitarian needs to Kharkiv. It partially worked, and then the warehouses with fabric started working, and to our surprise, there were much more orders from Ukraine. It was delightful!<br><br><strong>We continue to create for you!</strong></p>\n",

First, our workers were paid in March for February, although employees even refused it, knowing there was a war in the country. And one day, we decided that we simply could not do what we were doing and decided that we would continue to work and develop a new patriotic drop. There are risks at every stage of work, but we do not want to transfer production to other countries because we need to support the economy and workplaces. All our productions are working.

We founded Bagllet back in 2013 motivated by a desire to spread the aesthetic of minimalism through the creation of primaries for people who see beauty in everyday life.<br><br>The foundation of a laconic and neat product design is our traditions and experience. We are not just making but we are creating bags for you to have a part of a craftsmanship’s history.<br><br>The basis of our brand’s philosophy – simple and accurate lines combined with a timeless design and fine detailing. Each person is given their own, one-of-a-kind product, with its character and future story that is meant to be told.<br><br>Our product line consists of bags, backpacks, and accessories fully made of Italian handcrafted leather “Tuscany” with a special waterproof coating. We are not adding inner fabric lining, as we believe that the back of the skin is the best lining. The stiff structure of leather guarantees the bag will keep its shape for years. This approach lets us create beautiful and light-weighted bags while using materials consciously.<br><br>100% of the sales of the item you see in the last photo are transferred to the official account of the Armed Forces. All the reports about transferred money are posted weekly on our Instagram account. <br><br>We believe that even a small contribution from everyone can significantly help our army.</p>\n",

I decided to do something to occupy myself. Before that, I sometimes liked to weave and knit; I always made something but only something I would wear myself. I was interested in doing things for the first time and judging what turns out to be cool. So when the idea to make the bag of beads came up, I thought it was unreal. That there is not enough patience in me, that's why I immediately decided to try it!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I made the first handbag in 4 days without a clear vision of what it will be—pure improvisation. And for the next six months, I was constantly making them, putting them in a closet, or giving them to loved ones. I worked the same job in a real estate company, and when my friends said I needed to sell my bags commercially, I was sorry to let them go.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In November 2021, there were already too many handbags, and I started an Instagram page for them. It turned out that there were people who wanted it. In autumn and winter, 2-3 customers per handbag. In January, I could not work at home on bags and in the office as a realtor. The choice was easy.</p>\n<p>I buy, wash, go to the fishing store for threads, and buy more. I work during the day, at night, in the basement, and in traffic.</p>\n",

In the first days, we went through all emotions: hate, uncertainty about the future, and pain for our motherland. Now we are ready to fight, not with weapons, but with our work to overcome the economic crisis and potential unemployment. We feel responsible for our employees cause they have families, children, and their own needs. We also feel responsible for all of Ukraine as a business that influences the economic situation.</p>\n<p>So we decided to sell clothes abroad too. You can help all the Ukrainians to save their motherland.</p>\n<p>We are ready to work between air-raid warnings to sew clothes after leaving shelters.</p>\n<p>Support Ukraine and create your spring wardrobe, by buying fashion clothes made in Ukraine!

After two weeks of volunteering and collecting funds for the Territorial Defense of Kyiv, the Ethnodim team realized that it is necessary to resume work in order to provide its employees with wages and help the Armed Forces. Therefore, production was partially moved from Kyiv to Lviv.</p>\n<p>The experimental workshop was moved and production processes were adjusted at the new location. At the same time, a small-office showroom was opened for processing and issuing online orders.</p>\n<p>We saw that Ukrainians all over the world wanted to show their involvement in Ukraine, so they started ordering “vyshyvanki”, wearing them to rallies, volunteering, and supporting Ukraine in the cities they were currently in. Other nations also joined this movement, ordering clothes and other products from Ukrainian brands to show their support.</p>\n<p>At the end of April, almost the entire team returned to Kyiv to resume production and store operations. Since then, Etnodim has been working every day.</p>\n<p>Thanks to our work, we can support the army and provide social support to Ukrainian culture. In May, a collection dedicated to Ukrainian artists was released. We also launched a project called \"Museum Walls\", in which we bought tickets to Kyiv museums and gave them to our customers with the purchase of the embroidery.</p>\n<p>Before Independence Day, we agreed to a collaboration with the Vivat publishing house and purchased 500 books on the history of Ukraine, which were also given to our customers.</p>\n<p>In the future, we plan to further develop Ukrainian culture with the help of our clothes, our designs and, of course, carry a social mission.</p>\n",
