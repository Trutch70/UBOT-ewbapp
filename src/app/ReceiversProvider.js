        "description": "<p>PIECEOFSHIRT began as a vintage merch store, which grew into a brand with its own designs, the main specialty of which is bootlegs. Among PIECEOFSHIRT's most recognizable pieces are the charity drop T-shirts with “Stolen Island” and “Ukraine” prints, playing off the logos of Stone Island and musician Aphex Twin. The team sold 350 T-shirts and transferred 130 thousand hryvnias to volunteers.</p>\n<p>The brand's founder, <strong>Reshat Brat</strong>, has long been fond of skate culture: he skateboarded and collected merch from various music groups. In 2017, a year after moving to Kyiv, Reshat opened an Instagram store of vintage merch PIECEOFSHIRT, and this marked the beginning of the brand's story.</p>\n<blockquote><em>\"It was a way of communicating with the city; at that time, I didn't know anyone in Kyiv. I met a person, who gave away a T-shirt, </em><strong><em>but it was more important to me who I was selling it to than the fact of the sale itself</em></strong><em>.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p>Reshat always wanted to create his own clothing design: during the operation of the vintage store, he began to understand prints and materials, and in 2020, PIECEOFSHIRT presented the first collection.</p>\n<h3>About the team and production</h3>\n<p>There are two people on the team — Reshat, and Dima. Reshat deals with designs, organization of production, and content, and Dima deals with communication, sales, and shipments. Friends help them at almost all stages (correction of designs, production, sales, photo-video content).</p>\n<blockquote><em>\"If we talk about the beginning of PIECEOFSHIRT's existence, then </em><strong><em>the team first appeared, and then the brand</em></strong><em>. My brothers Ivan and Danylo helped start production and promote designs based on my eponymous Instagram store with vintage merch in 2020,”.</em></blockquote>\n<p>The idea behind the PIECEOFSHIRT brand is to develop limited edition drops printed on vintage t-shirts. However, production was never constant.</p>\n<blockquote><em>\"We just dropped new things when there was time and inspiration. All previous and current drops were printed in Kyiv with the participation of our friend Anton (Walls Press). From February 24 to April 1, he and his family were in Plakhtianka, Makariv district, under the occupation of the Russian invaders, almost without communication. Everyone here was worried and waiting for him. Fortunately, he overcame his terrible test of fate and returned to Kyiv.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p>The first items of the brand were long sleeves with bootleg design \"ЦОЙ DIVISION\" (TSOI DIVISION, which refers to Victor Tsoi) and the series dedicated to the pandemic \"STAY AWAY\" + \"2020\". Longsleeves \"Х*Й ВОЙНЕ\" (FUCK THE WAR) were released next: 21 units of a single edition were sold in less than a day.</p>\n<blockquote><em>\"Playing logos, making bootlegs (in PIECEOFSHIRT's case, ironic parodies) is our forte. This is a fairly common technique, with the help of which the design first attracts attention as something quite familiar, and only then conveys the author's opinion,\"</em></blockquote>\n<p>For us, as well as for many, the words <strong>Made in Ukraine</strong> are extremely powerful. And we want our business to consist entirely of these powerful words.</p>\n",

One package contains 60 pieces, designed for daily use during the month. <br><br>KYSEN’ founder Serhii Poroshenko's comment on how the war affected the work of the brand:</p>\n<blockquote><em>“We had planned to launch the production of eye patches in Ukraine before the war. We had almost everything for this: equipment (which passed certification in 2020 and 2021), production technology cards and raw materials, but the war changed our plans. As a result, in March 2022 we lost one warehouse with a majority of our products (Kyiv region) and the second one in April (Vinnytsia region). It was quite hard for me to go through what happened, but the essential thing is that the whole team is alive. So in April when most people were still in a stupor due to the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, I decided to act. In peacetime, we were planning to produce this blue and yellow eye patch line for the Independence Day of Ukraine, but it became our manifestation of courage here and now. It is the kind of courage that resonates with the main idea of the Brave.ua campaign. So, that’s how the idea of creating blue and yellow patches in collaboration with Brave.ua appeared. Now our team is rapidly growing and developing. We see that our products are top-rated, so we are planning to enter European and American markets. We believe that the future belongs to the brave, and victory to those who will not back down!”</em></blockquote>\n",

This inspired me to start upcycling.</em></p>\n<p><em>In general, upcycling (</em><strong><em>up+recycling</em></strong><em>) is the process of creative rethinking and transforming left-out materials or abandoned things into new products with a higher value, in order to reduce waste and to preserve resources.</em></p>\n<p><em>In my work, the main aim is to bring the artistic interpretation of authentic features, meanings, and memory, still carried by upcycled objects, in order to transfer the energy embodied in the material - μεταφορά (from the Ancient Greek - transference). </em></p>\n<p><em>With such a conversion, I strive to reproduce a certain harmony that I feel, believing that my creations radiate the vital vibes I put into them.</em></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The upcycling manufactory Metåfora is currently at the initial stage of its development, being gradually implemented on the basis of a Kyiv local independent center of informal culture and creative practices - Ostriv Platform, as in an incubator with a dynamic creative environment and technical conditions for experimentation and prototyping.</p>\n<p><strong>The future plan</strong> is to develop the upcycling manufactory Metåfora to the level of a permanent creative ecological and social enterprise that would work on the principle of \"zero waste\".&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It will become both a creative, experimental laboratory and a cultural and educational center that will unite and expand a community of creative conscious people with common values of love for nature and caring for its resources.</p>\n<p><strong>There is a war</strong></p>\n<p>Russia's war against Ukraine completely changed my life and plans. But thanks to our defenders, I manage to stay at home in Kyiv with my friends and relatives.</p>\n<p>In the first months of the war, our creative workshop functioned as a humanitarian headquarters and all artistic projects were stopped because they were considered out of date and seemed to have lost their value.</p>\n<p>But now I feel that, in contrast to all the horror and constant threats that the enemy has brought to my homeland and compatriots, there is a growing need to affirm life in all ways, to express my identity and to be useful with my skills. Therefore, I will continue the implementation of the project as far and as long as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n",

Yes, we know it's a little bit strange - it's grey and wet and freezing so it's hard to enjoy it. But for us, it is a month of love because we, the brand's founders - Victoria Furmanyuk and Andriy Bushmakin - met each other in February. No surprise we launched our brand in February as well, in 2020. And maybe one day our colorful sweaters will make you love this month as much as we do.</p>\n<h3>Bright colors</h3>\n<p>In Feb we believe that after the rain always comes the rainbow. This natural phenomenon is our eternal source of inspiration and hope for the best.</p>\n<h3>Slow fashion</h3>\n<p>We're not in a hurry to become huge. It's important for us to stay honest and be able to afford ourselves the luxury of slowing down and growing naturally. This means we always have a permanent line and new colors and styles will be added as time goes on. We also produce our sweaters in small quantities to avoid overproduction and dead stock. We appreciate your patience if the color or style required is not available at the moment and you have to wait for a little to get your own Feb sweater.</p>\n<h3>No trends and fashion seasons</h3>\n<p>In Feb we want you to wear sweaters all day, day after day, season after season. That's why we source the finest quality Italian merino wool and produce our sweaters at a small Kyiv-based atelier so we can pay attention to every detail and step of creating Feb products. They are cool in winter and summer no matter if it is 2020, 2025, or 2030 - Feb sweaters are made to last.</p>\n",

I liked to watch the development of the life of the plants, and how they germinated, ripened, and gave a harvest. That was the time when the idea of giving this feeling to people was born in my head.</p>\n<p>I accidentally came across microgreens, read about them, and started growing them at home.</p>\n<p>I realised: I want to create kits for you to grow greens yourself. But not in the way it was on the market (products from plastic and unprofessional attitude towards the client), but something special, from which you can make a brand.</p>\n<p>I found a designer with whom we became partners for a while and started developing the product. <strong>A beautiful, eco-friendly product.</strong></p>\n<p>When the full-scale war began, we stopped somewhere at the end of March until our regular customers started writing to us with the desire to order something.</p>\n<p>Then people began to return to Ukraine, and our sets began to be taken as a gift: \"my friend/girlfriend/mother returned to Ukraine, I want to congratulate her,\" that's what clients often told us.</p>\n<p><strong>We believe Ukraine will win the war and the Ukrainian market will prosper, but we want to go global.</strong></p>\n<p>Customers often tell us that they want something new in growing, so we have started producing mushroom grow kits, and we will be adding new kits for growing mint and basil in the coming months.</p>\n<p><strong>The war did not break, nor does it tire us: we have our own front - we create value for those on the home front.</strong> So they could stay in better shape and help our warriors on the front in a better way.</p>\n<p><strong>From selling our products, we pay taxes, donate to foundations, pay suppliers, and our team.</strong></p>\n<p>To get a microgreen eco-kit from grow-some, please write us directly on Instagram.</p>\n",

We founded Bagllet back in 2013 motivated by a desire to spread the aesthetic of minimalism through the creation of primaries for people who see beauty in everyday life.<br><br>The foundation of a laconic and neat product design is our traditions and experience. We are not just making but we are creating bags for you to have a part of a craftsmanship’s history.<br><br>The basis of our brand’s philosophy – simple and accurate lines combined with a timeless design and fine detailing. Each person is given their own, one-of-a-kind product, with its character and future story that is meant to be told.<br><br>Our product line consists of bags, backpacks, and accessories fully made of Italian handcrafted leather “Tuscany” with a special waterproof coating. We are not adding inner fabric lining, as we believe that the back of the skin is the best lining. The stiff structure of leather guarantees the bag will keep its shape for years. This approach lets us create beautiful and light-weighted bags while using materials consciously.<br><br>100% of the sales of the item you see in the last photo are transferred to the official account of the Armed Forces. All the reports about transferred money are posted weekly on our Instagram account. <br><br>We believe that even a small contribution from everyone can significantly help our army.</p>\n",

I decided to do something to occupy myself. Before that, I sometimes liked to weave and knit; I always made something but only something I would wear myself. I was interested in doing things for the first time and judging what turns out to be cool. So when the idea to make the bag of beads came up, I thought it was unreal. That there is not enough patience in me, that's why I immediately decided to try it!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I made the first handbag in 4 days without a clear vision of what it will be—pure improvisation. And for the next six months, I was constantly making them, putting them in a closet, or giving them to loved ones. I worked the same job in a real estate company, and when my friends said I needed to sell my bags commercially, I was sorry to let them go.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In November 2021, there were already too many handbags, and I started an Instagram page for them. It turned out that there were people who wanted it. In autumn and winter, 2-3 customers per handbag. In January, I could not work at home on bags and in the office as a realtor. The choice was easy.</p>\n<p>I buy, wash, go to the fishing store for threads, and buy more. I work during the day, at night, in the basement, and in traffic.</p>\n",
